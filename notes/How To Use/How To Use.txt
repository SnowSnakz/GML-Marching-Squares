Marching Squares is a polygonization algorithm which takes in a 2D grid of density points and
generates a mesh encompassing the area where the density is above a certain threshold.

In order to use this algorithm, you must call the function below.

marching_squares(iso_level, is_clockwise, grid, scale_x, scale_y)

The iso_level is the boundry between air and solid.
For grids with a density range of -1 to 1, a value of 0 is recommended.
For grids with a density range of 0 to 1, a value of 0.5 is recommended.

is_clockwise is a boolean that determines the order in which vertices are generated.
If is_clockwise is true, vertices are generated clockwise, otherwise they are generated counter clock-wise.
This is useful when implementing backface culling.

grid should be a DS Grid containing the density values.

scale_x and scale_y should be the size of each cell in object space (pixels if you don't apply transformations.)
